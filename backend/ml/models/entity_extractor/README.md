# Entity Extractor Models

This folder will contain entity extraction models after you run `../notebooks/03_entity_extraction.ipynb`.

## Currently Empty?

**This is normal!** Run the notebook to generate extractors.

## After Training

You'll see:
- `rule_based_extractor.pkl` - Rule-based extractor (always available)
- `spacy_extractor.pkl` - spaCy-based extractor (if spaCy installed)
